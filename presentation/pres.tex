\frametitle{Before you start the calculations}
\begin{enumerate}  
\item Just go in the pwteleman directory and enter {\tt source ./install_pwteleman} and follow the instructions
\item The only prerequisite is a working {\tt gfortran} in your path (type  {\tt sudo apt-get install gfortran} if you have root on Linux)
\item Enter {\tt source ./install_pwteleman d } for gfortran compilation with debug options 
\item  {\tt source ./install_pwteleman a }for all possible compilations, if you have Intel Fortran Compiler and NVCC 

\item   {\tt source ./install_pwteleman t }to test your results and cross-correlate them against reference results  (quite long) 
\item  At any time you can try {\tt code/source_f90/regressionmatrix} to measure the change in your results vs reference results 
\item   {\tt source ./install_pwteleman i } for GPU compilations only (if you have Intel Fortran and NVCC) 
\item if it fails  to {\tt source\_f90} directory :\\
\vspace*{0.2cm}
{\tt cd pw-teleman\_dev-all\_20131009/code/source\_f90/
}\\
\vspace*{0.2cm}
Before compilation, you might want to update some settings,\\ for detailed explanations see {\tt openmp\_explain.txt}.
\vspace*{0.2cm}
\item To use environment modules for compiling or running a code you have to load a particular module\\
\vspace*{0.2cm}
{\tt module load <module name>}
\vspace*{0.2cm}
\item For GPUs see {\tt gpu\_explain.txt}).
\item Execute {\tt make} command which you can modify in several ways (see {\tt openmp\_explain.txt}). In our example we compile the code with FFTW functions using parallelization for wavefunctions:\\
\vspace*{0.2cm}
\vspace*{0.2cm}
{\tt ./make.sh 1 fftw} 
\vspace*{0.2cm}
\item The executable will be copied to the working
 directory which is one level below the sub-directory {\tt source\_f90}. The file called {\tt pwteleman.par} is
 the new executable.

\vspace*{0.2cm}

{\tt mpirun -np 8 ../../code/pwteleman.par}\\

You need to increase {\tt ismax}  and {\tt itmax}  to larger values in file  {\tt for005.na8jel  } 
and rerun the code, maybe  in batch mode 
To obtain the data for absorption spectra you need to compile and run a {\tt spectr2.F90} code:\\

{\tt cd pw-teleman\_dev-all\_20131009/code/source\_aux}\\
\vspace*{0.1cm}

{\tt ../../code/source\_aux/spectr < pdip.na8-jel > spectra}\\
\vspace*{0.2cm}
Data you need to plot absorption spectra will be collected in {\tt spectra}, make the file readable to gnuplot and then:\\
\vspace*{0.2cm}

{\tt gnuplot> set xlabel 'Energy [eV]'\\
gnuplot> set ylabel 'oscillator strength'\\
gnuplot> unset key \\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Go the {\tt H2} directory\\
\vspace*{0.2cm}
{\tt cd pw-teleman\_dev-all\_20131009/samples_py/H2}\\
\vspace*{0.2cm}
you should see following files:\\

{\tt for005ion.H2} &{\scriptsize{\textcolor{red}{ionic configuration of cluster}}}\\
\end{tabular}
\vspace*{0.4cm}


\item Open and read the sample file {\tt for005.H2}, there are three namelists:\\
\vspace*{0.4cm}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
 {\tt \&GLOBAL} & {\scriptsize{\textcolor{red}{choice of the system, initialization of wave functions, convergence issues}}}\\
{\tt \&DYNAMIC}&{\scriptsize{\textcolor{red}{numerical and physical parameters for statics and dynamics, }}}\\
&{\scriptsize{\textcolor{red}{way of excitation, flags for observables}}}\\
 {\tt \&PERIO}&{\scriptsize{\textcolor{red}{needed when  {\tt ipsptype=1}}}}\\
 \vspace*{0.2cm}
\end{tabular}
In file {\tt openmp\_explain.txt} you can find complete description of the parameters used in the input. 
You can alternatively input  {\tt ipsptype=3} or  {\tt ipsptype=4} in which case the pseudopotential
parameters are read from file {\tt goed.asci} and {\tt periodic}  which you need in the present directory.
You can alternatively use  {\tt nclust=0} in which case the total number of electrons is automatically computed.
(see anilin example)
If you set a negative {\tt dx,dy,dz} the optimal value will be determinated from the pseudopotential file
and a recommanded {\tt kxbox, kybox,kzbox} will be given and written to file {\tt nx}. The program then quits. In the
next run, this value will be used.

In case when the number of the wavefunctions is too little the calculations might fail, thus, in this example we will run the code in serial. \\
\vspace*{0.4cm}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Go to {\tt source\_f90} directory:\\
\vspace*{0.2cm}
{\tt cd ..}\\
{\tt cd ..}\\
{\tt cd code/source\_f90/}\\
\vspace*{0.2cm}
\item Execute {\tt make} command and compile the code with FFTW functions to produce serial code:\\
\vspace*{0.2cm}
{\tt ./make.sh 0 fftw}\\
\vspace*{0.2cm}
The new executable called {\tt pwteleman.seq} will be in the directory {\tt code} which is one level below the sub-directory {\tt source\_f90}\\
\vspace*{0.4cm}
\item  Go back to the {\tt H2} directory and run the code:\\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\begin{enumerate}
\item You will get several output files, e.g.:\\

{\tt pposion.H2} & {\small{\textcolor{red}{ionic positions}}}\\
\end{tabular}
\vspace*{0.2cm}
\item The last one {\tt pposion.H2} will be needed to estimate the oscillation period of diatomic hydrogen. \\
\vspace*{0.2cm}
\item Use plotting software to draw   'Positions vs Time' graph, \\e.g. with gnuplot:\\
\vspace*{0.1cm}
{\tt gnuplot> set ylabel 'Positions'}\\
{\tt gnuplot> set xlabel 'Time'}\\
{\tt gnuplot> set xrange [0:20]}\\

\item Go the {\tt na9-jel} directory\\
\vspace*{0.2cm}
{\tt cd pw-teleman\_dev-all\_20131009/samples/na8-jel}\\
\vspace*{0.2cm}
you should see following files:\\
\vspace*{0.2cm}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
{\tt for005.na9-jel} &{\scriptsize{\textcolor{red}{general input for settings, static and dynamics}}}\\
{\tt for005}  &{\scriptsize{\textcolor{red}{defines the qualifier na9-jel for the other {\tt for005} files}}}\\
\end{tabular}
\vspace*{0.4cm}


\item In the sample file {\tt for005.na9-jel} you should notice that {\tt nion2} paremeter is set to {\tt 0} what stands for jellium background

\item To obtain the absorption spectra and dipole moment you should analogously follow the steps from the previous example.

To check the total energy of the molecule as a function of time follow the steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item go to the {\tt H2} directory\\
{\tt cd pw-teleman\_dev-all\_20131009/samples_py/H2}
\item If you performed the previous calculations concerning H2, you should find there a file containing energy informations called {\tt penergies.H2}. 
\item To draw   'Positions vs Time' graph, you can use e.g. gnuplot:\\
\vspace*{0.1cm}
{\tt gnuplot> set ylabel 'Total energy'}\\
{\tt gnuplot> set xlabel 'Time step'}\\
{\tt gnuplot> unset key}\\
{\tt gnuplot> plot './penergies.H2' u 1:18 w l}\\


\end{enumerate}

\vspace*{0.2cm}

\item In this case we use in {\tt anilin.py} the default settings of the ASE-PWTELEMAN calculator,
\item Grid spacing and total charge will be set automatically from the {\tt goed.asci} Goedecker pseudopotential file 
\item Default values have to be given for the 'static' mode of calculation 
\item Only the number of dynamic iterations and time steps/excitation have to be given for the 
'plasmon' mode
\item The same goes for the simplified porphyrin_mg molecule, with a much larger number of electrons
