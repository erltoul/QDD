The changes in the branch 'dev-pgr' were mainly concerned with
elimintaing compile-time switches in 'define.h' and replacing them by
run-time options. The following changes were done so far:

compile-time switch                      run-time variable
---------------------                    ------------------------------
gunnar,exonly,pw92            -->        'idenfunc'
                                          (1 = P&W, 2=G&L, 3=x only)
fullspin                      -->        'numspin' (2= full spin code)
kli                           -->        already contained in 'ifsicp'
exchange                      -->        already contained in 'ifsicp'
directenergy                  -->        'directenergy' (.true./.false.)

For the usage of the new run-time variables see the file
