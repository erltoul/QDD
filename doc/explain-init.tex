\section{Installation and usage}

\subsection{Installation}
The following steps assume that you have successfully unpacked
the code and that you are now in the sub-directory 'source\_f90'.

Before compilation, one should update some settings
(for detailed explanations of the parameters see section \ref{sec:inputs}):
\begin{itemize}
\item
 Edit 'define.h' to choose the wanted code options.
\item
 Edit 'params.F90' if you need to change some limiting values
 (rarely required).
\item
 Edit 'makefile' and insert your compiler with its appropriate
 options. Some lines for that are provided and presently commented out.
 Fill the lines and remove the comments if needed.
\item
 Finally execute 'make'. The executable will be copied to the working
 directory which is one level below the sub-directory 'source\_f90'.
 Go back to the working directory. The last file called 'tdks*' is
 the new executable.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Basic input structure}
The cluster 3D code has six entries for options:
\\[-28pt]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\it compile time}\\
 {\tt define.h} & variants of the code\\
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\it run time}\\
 {\tt for005.<name>} & general input for settings, static and
 dynamics\\
 {\tt for005ion.<name>} & ionic configuration of cluster\\
 {\tt for005surf.<name>} & atomic configuration of substrate (optional)\\
 {\tt for005} & defines the qualifier {\tt <name>} for 
                the other {\tt for005...} files\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The first two entries have to be set before compilation. The
other four are read in for an actual run and can be varied from
run to run. The input structure for these files is summarized
in section \ref{sec:inputs}.

\subsection{Some practical advices}

\begin{description}

 \item{Important compile-time settings:}\\
  You have to chose the wnated options in 'define.h'.

 \item{Save and restart:}\\
  The parameters 'isave', 'istat', and 'irest' allow to switch
  saving wavefunctions and restarting from them.\\
  For {\tt ismax>0} and  {\tt isave>1}, 
  the static wavefunctions are saved on {\tt rsave}
  after the static iterations. These can be used in two ways.
  Setting  {\tt istat=1} and  {\tt ismax>0} continues static
  iteration from  {\tt rsave}. Setting  {\tt ismax=0},  {\tt istat=1},
  {\tt irest=0}, and, of course,  {\tt itmax>0} starts a dynamical
  run at time zero with the static wavefunctions from  {\tt rsave}.
  \\
  Dynamical configurations are saved on  {\tt save.<name>} after every
  {\tt isave} time steps. Setting  {\tt irest=1} will
  continue the dymaical calculation 
  from the stage saved in  {\tt save.<name>}.

 \item{Diagonalization amongst occupied states:}\\
  The run time option {\tt ifhamdiag=1}
  activates the diagonalization of the mean-field Hamiltonian
  amongst the active wavefunctions in each static iteration
  step. This option can accelerate the convergence of the static
  solution significantly. {\it However:} At present, this method works 
  safely only if the number of active states {\tt nstate}
  equals the actual number of electrons. This has to be checked 
  by the user. It may work in other cases, but may also induce
  oscillating iteration  which nevers converges.

\section{On the initialization of the electronic wavefunctions}
\label{sec:inite}

The basic switch is {\tt init\_lcao}. \underline{The case
{\tt init\_lcao=0}} is the simpler option. This initializes harmonic
oscillator wavefunctions about one common center. This center is
usually the origin of the coordinte-space grid. It can be moved
deliberately by {\tt shiftWFx}, {\tt shiftWFy}, and {\tt shiftWFz}.
The initial oscillator may be deformed. Its deformation is given by
the dimensionless quadrupole {\tt b2occ} and triaxiality {\tt gamocc}
(in degree). The oscillator states are filled in order of
increasing oscillator energies. A spin asymmtry can be enforced
with {\tt ispinsep=1}. This option is useful when dealing with odd
electron number. The upper end of initialization is determined by
{\tt deocc}. A {\tt deocc $\approx$ 0} typically initializes just as many
states as are occupied. If more is required, enhance {\tt deocc}.

\underline{The case {\tt init\_lcao=1}} initializes wavefunctions
which are localized at the ions. This option is richer and a bit hard
to handle. In a first step, the total number of wavefunctions is
estimated and it is computed how many wavefunctions have to be
initialized then for each ion. At one given ion, initialization starts
with the $1s$ oscillator state. The first choice of spin is taken from
column 7 of {\tt for005ion.<name>} {which initializes the entry of the
  actual ion in the the {\tt ipol}
array. The value {\tt ipol=+1} sets a spin up (i.e. {\tt ispin=1} in
the code) as the first choice, 
while {\tt ipol=-1} sets a spin down (i.e. {\tt ispin=2}).} If more than one state is to be
occupied, the next is then the $1s$ state with opposite spin. Next
comes the $1p_i$ state with first spin where $i$ is the direction
given as first entry in column 5. For example if column 5 selects
{\tt 'yzx'}, the $1p_y$ comes here. Occupation continues in order
given by column 5 and 7 until the wanted number of orbitals at this
ion site is reached. Column 6 sets the oscillator radius for the
initialization at this ion (which allows to deal efficiently with
systems consisting of very different ions). Column 7 becomes important
for ions associated with an odd number of electrons as, e.g.,
hydrogen. One ought to distribute an equal collection of 
%{\tt +1} and {\tt -1} entries
{spins up and down over the whole system} to avoid unnaturally 
polarized molecules.

\section{Open ends and to-be-dones}

{\Large\bf Status of Fortran90 code development:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
    All {\tt common} blocks have been replaced by modules
    and corresponding {\tt USE} command. The then appearing
    dependences are mapped in the {\tt makefile}.
  \item
    All code is now genuinly double precision and can be
    complied without the {\tt autodouble} option. Only exception
    if the FFT package {\tt fftpack.F90} in connection with {\tt
      NETLIB}
    which still requires
    the  {\tt autodouble}, as handled explicitely in the
    {\tt Makefile}.
    \\
    Note that the precision is set at the header of {\tt params.F90}
    and used as a {\tt KIND} parameter in typical Fortran90 fashion.
    The name is set to {\tt DP}.
  \item
    The somewhat dangerous practice of reusing workspace has been
    abandoned. Workspace is now associated dynamically with
    the {\tt ALLOCATE}/{\tt DEALLOCATE} mechanisms.
  \item
    The compiled code works now for all box sizes and number of s.p.
    states as long as memory allows. The box size and maximum number
    of states is now entered in {\tt for005.<name>} in namelist
    {\tt GLOBAL}.
\end{itemize}

{\Large\bf Next in Fortran90 code development:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Remove numbered labels and {\tt GOTO} in favour of
        {\tt CYCLE} or {\tt EXIT} switches.
  \item Exploit compact vector operations to simplify
        long (and nested) {\tt DO} loops.
  \item The access {\tt USE kinetic} has been given too generously.
        Confine that to routines which really need it.
  \item The module {\tt params.F90} collects practically all
        global variables. It should be disentangled to more
        specific modules with restricted access. 
  \item There are still problems with running substrates.
        For example the leap-frog switch does not propagate the
        substrate electrons.
        This case has to be tested.
        \\
        In future, it may be that the whole subtrate part
        is trated in a separate program connected to the electronic
        part by a master routine written in {ttt python}.
  \item Full SIC has yet to be implemented.
  \item The code should be successively moved to {\tt IMPLICIT NONE}.
\end{itemize}

\newpage

{\Large\bf Open problems of general nature:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The implementation of GSlat and full SIC needs to be checked
        and updated if necessary.
  \item Check PES and PAD for the option  {\tt parayes}.
  \item Option {\tt iaddCluster} is presently questionable. 
        It may be extended to allow
        for initialization of cluster collisions.
  \item The computation of pseudo-potentials from the substrates
        valence electrons should be separated from the slower
        atomic (ionic) parts. This concerns routine {\tt calcpseudo}.
  \item The setting for the valence-electron mass in 'vstep'
        may be wrong for the case of MgO.
  \item Check proper setting of 'time' in outputs.
  \item Exponential propagation should yet be certified to cooperate
        with ionic motion.
  \item Subgrids for Gaussian pseudo-densities have fixed grid size
        of $\pm 7$ points. This should be made more flexible to
        accommodate mesh size in relation for PsP radius.
  \item Although not necessary for performance, one may replace
        DO loops by the Fortran 95 SUM construct. This will make the
        code more transparent. This also holds for other compact
        Fortran 95 constructs.
  \item Present parallele version  still needs to specify the number
        of nodes at compile time. This should be 
        changed to allow dynamical adjustment of number of nodes.
  \item Spin-averaged code ({\tt numspin}=1) does not reproduce 
        the results from full spin calculation in case of ADSIC.
        Check.
\end{itemize}
