We study the excitation cross section of atoms and small molecules
under the influence of highly relativistic charged ions as they occur
in storage rings and accelerators. Starting from fully time resolved
calculations of the electronic dynamics, we study a set of
complementing approximations, a sudden approximation for the extremely
fast collision at low impact parameter combined with time-dependent
perturbation theory for the weak and slow collisions at large impact
parameters. This leads eventually to a simple, yet reliable, estimate
in terms of the ion-hydrogen cross section and the variance of the
dipole moment for the actual system. We are discussing, in particular,
the systems H, He, C, N, O, Ne, H$_2$, and N$_2$

We present a theoretical study of the angular distribution of emitted
electrons of a sodium cluster, irradiated by a short and intense laser
pulses. While the polarization of the excitation field tends to focus
a directional emission, dynamical correlations tend to thermalize the
electrons, giving rise to a more isotropic ionization. The competition
between these processes is investigated using a semi-classical model
(VUU), where the dynamical correlations are taken in account by
electron-electron correlations in Markovian approximation, the widely
known \"Uhling-Uhlenbeck collision term.  The results are compared to
a semi-classical pure mean-field propagation ({V}lasov equation), to
work out the influence of dynamical correlations on the angular
distribution of the electron emission. Trends with laser intensity and
frequency are explored. The time evoluation of the angular
distributions shows that direct emission processes are stronger in the
early phase of the processs while isotropic thermal emission dominates
later.

We investigate from a practitioner's point of view the computation of
the ionization potential (IP) within density functional theory
(DFT). DFT with (semi-)local energy-density functionals is plagued by
a self-interaction error which hampers the computation of IP from the
single-particle energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO). The problem may be cured by a self interaction correction
(SIC) for which there exist various approximate treatments. We compare
the performance of the SIC proposed by Perdew and Zunger with the
very simple average-density SIC (ADSIC) for a large variety of atoms
and molecules up to larger systems as carbon rings and chains.
Both approaches to SIC provide a large improvement to the quality of the
IP if calculated from the HOMO level. The surprising result is that the 
simple ADSIC performs even better than the original Perdew-Zunger SIC 
(PZSIC) in the majority of the studied cases.

Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock calculations of nuclear giant resonance
states are performed in the linear response domain, with emphasis on a
systematic analysis of techniques to cope with continuum effects in a
finite basis.  These techniques are the use of absorbing boundary
conditions in the time-dependent calculations, and
filtering in the subsequent linear response analysis of the spectra.
A judicious combination of these techniques results in spectra close
to those of true continuum calculations at a much reduced
computational cost.  The example of giant monopole resonances in
$^{16}$O nuclei is considered.

  abstract={In order to study the gross effects of particle
                  collisions, we formulate a model to include particle
                  mean-field theory. The model consists of the
                  time-dependent collisions in the time-dependent
                  Hartree-Fock equation for the single-particle states
                  and a linearized but truncated equation for the
                  occupation numbers, with the H-theorem and the
                  conservation laws properly satisfied. Numerical
                  calculations are performed with a "conventional" set
                  of basis states in which the occupied and the
                  unoccupied static Hartree-Fock states are boosted in
                  the same way. They are carried out for the head-on
                  collisions of ' on Ca and 'Si on Si at 100 MeV per
                  nucleon. It is found that the dynamics of the
                  reaction is affected in only a minor way when
                  particle collisions are included. The projectile and
                  the target nuclear matter appear to interpenetrate
                  each other, with only a 20\% reduc- tion in the
                  center-of-mass kinetic energies, just as in
                  mean-field calculations with no particle col-
                  lisions. This result reinforces the idea that the
                  conventional basis states do not include some impor-
                  tant degrees of freedom. It is suggested that in
                  future work one should modify the basis in order to
                  allow for ample wave propagation in the direction
                  normal to the collision axis.  }

The scheme is solved on a numerical grid in

of one-photon emission analytical formulae for computing the
orientation averaged PAD on the basis of a few TDLDA-SIC

that all information in the averaged PAD is contained in one
anisotropy parameter. We find that this parameter varies very little
with system size, but as a whole is crucially influenced by the
detailed ionic structure.  We also compare with direct orientation
averaging and consider one example reaching outside the perturbative

  abstract= { There are various ways to analyze the dynamical response
                  of clusters and molecules to electromagnetic
                  perturbations. Particularly rich information can be
                  obtained from measuring the properties of electrons
                  emitted in the course of the excitation
                  dynamics. Such an analysis of electron signals
                  covers observables as net ionization, Photo-Electron
                  Spectra (PES), Photo-electron Angular Distributions
                  (PAD), and ideally combined PES/PAD. It has a long
                  history in molecular physics and was increasingly
                  used in cluster physics as well.  Recent progress in
                  the design of new light sources (high intensity,
                  high frequency, ultra short pulses) opens new
                  possibilities for measurement and thus has renewed
                  the interest on these observables, especially for
                  the analysis of various dynamical scenarios, well
                  beyond a simple access to electronic density of
                  states.  This, in turn, has motivated many
                  theoretical investigations of the dynamics of
                  electronic emission for molecules and clusters up to
                  such a complex and interesting system as C$_{60}$.
                  A theoretical tool of choice is here Time Dependent
                  Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) propagated in real
                  time and on a spatial grid, and augmented by a
                  Self-Interaction Correction (SIC).  This provides a
                  pertinent, robust, and efficient description of
                  electronic emission including the detailed pattern
                  of PES and PAD.  A direct comparison between
                  experiments and well founded elaborate microscopic
                  theories is thus readily possible, at variance with
                  more demanding observables such as for example
                  fragmentation or dissociation cross sections.  
                  The  purpose of this review is to describe the
                  theoretical tools developed on the basis of real
                  time and real space TDDFT to address in a realistic
                  manner the analysis of electronic emission following
                  irradiation of clusters and molecules by various
                  laser pulses.  After a general introduction, we
                  shall in a first part present the available
                  experimental results motivating such studies,
                  starting from the simplest total ionization signals
                  to the more elaborate PES and PAD, possibly
                  combining them and/or resolving them in time. This
                  experimental discussion will be complemented in a
                  second part by a presentation of available
                  theoretical tools focusing on TDDFT and detailing
                  the methods used to address ionization observables.
                  We shall also discuss the shortcomings of standard
                  versions of TDDFT, especially what concerns the SIC
                  problem, and show how to formally and practically
                  improve the theory on that aspect. A long third part
                  will be devoted to representative results. We shall
                  illustrate the use of total ionization in pump and
                  probe scenarios for tracking ionic dynamics in
                  clusters. PES and PAD will allow to more directly
                  address electronic dynamics itself. We shall in
                  particular discuss the impact of the dynamical
                  regime on PES and PAD.  When possible, the results
                  will be directly compared to experiments.  We shall
                  end this third part by a discussion on the
                  information content of energy/angular spectra of
                  emitted electrons in case of excitation by swift and
                  highly charged ions rather than lasers. The fourth
                  part of the paper will be devoted to future
                  directions of investigations.  From the rich choice
                  of developments, we shall in particular address two
                  aspects.  The first one concerns the account of
                  dissipative effects in TDDFT to be able to consider
                  longer laser pulses where the competition between
                  direct electron emission and thermalization is known
                  to play a role as, e.g., in experiments with
                  C$_{60}$.  Although such questions have been
                  superficially addressed in the simple case of
                  alkaline clusters by means of semi-classical
                  methods, no satisfying quantum formulation,
                  compulsory for most realistic systems, is yet
                  available. The second aspect concerns pump and probe
                  scenarios with attosecond lasers. The challenge is
                  there more on the capability to define proper
                  signals to be measured/computed at such a short time
                  scale. The TDDFT analysis provides here a valuable
                  tool in the search for the most efficient
                  observables. First encouraging results will be
                  presented on that occasion. We shall finally give a
                  short conclusion.  }

                  different photo-excitation conditions are
                  considered: excitation with high frequency XUV light
                  at 20~eV and with a low frequency IR femtosecond
                  pulse at 1.55~eV. The interaction with the XUV light
                  leads to a one-photon transition and linear
                  ionization regime. In that situation, the spectrum
                  of occupied single electron states in $\csixty$ is
                  directly mapped to the photoelectron spectrum. On

                  be understood by the theoretical underestimation of

                  electron-electron scattering. These results pave the

  abstract= { 
We propose a relaxation time approximation for the description of the
dynamics of strongly excited fermion systems. Our approach is based on
time-dependent density functional theory at the level of the local
density approximation. This mean-field picture is augmented by
collisional correlations handled in relaxation time approximation
which is inspired from the corresponding semi-classical picture. The
method involves the estimate of microscopic relaxation rates/times
which is presently taken from the well established semi-classical
experience.  The relaxation time approximation implies evaluation of
the instantaneous equilibrium state towards which the dynamical state
is progressively driven at the pace of the microscopic relaxation
time.
%
As test case, we consider Na clusters of various sizes excited
either by a swift ion projectile or by a short and intense laser pulse,
driven in various dynamical regimes ranging from linear to 
strongly non-linear reactions. We observe a strong effect of
dissipation on sensitive observables such as net ionization and
angular distributions of emitted electrons. The effect is especially
large for moderate excitations where typical relaxation/dissipation
time scales efficiently compete with ionization for dissipating the
available excitation energy. Technical details on the actual procedure
to implement a working recipe of such a quantum relaxation
approximation are given in appendices for completeness.
