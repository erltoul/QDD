1) makefile & define.h:
      these files contain the option for an actual compilation;
      we have to write documentation which options exist, how
      to enter them, and where to enter them. Presently an
      older version of that exsists in 'doc/explain.pdf'.
      This needs update and a summary in the header of
      'makefile' or 'make.sh'.

2) entry of options:
      trhough 'define.h' as well as through 'makefile'
      try to have only one channel
      possibly write a batch file with interactive entry of options
      (see 'make.sh')

3) redundant compile-time options: 
      redunant options gridfft <-->  netlib_fft & fftw_cpu; 
      try to deduce gridfft from both others

4) option 'coudoub3D':
      check performance on various platforms and decide for one option

5) finite differences:
      this seems to be installed, but requires more testing;
      before spending time on that, run benchmarks.

6) raregas:
      this option has not been used for long, need testing.
