1) Preprocessor options:
     Now all in 'Makefile' and reduced to a minimum.

2) option 'coudoub3D':
     This option has been moved to a '#define' inside the Coulomb
     package such that it can be chanegd onyl by nerds.

3) finite differences:
     Has been seperated as far as possible. Will be skipped in
     public version while being kept in an archive version.
     Requires more testing.

4) raregas:
     This option will be skipped in public version.

5) 'calc_projFine':
     This version presently only for electronic part, not yet
     in ionic force. Should we put it there also?

6) preprocessor option 'simpar':
     Could be removed. 

7) Subroutine 'mergetabs':
     What is this routine doing?
