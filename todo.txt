1) Preprocessor options:
     Now all in 'Makefile' and reduced to a minimum.

2) option 'coudoub3D':
     This option has been moved to a '#define' inside the Coulomb
     package such that it can be chanegd onyl by nerds.

3) finite differences:
     Has been seperated as far as possible. Will be skipped in
     public version while being kept in an archive version.
     The 'findiff.F90' has been moved to an own subdirectory to
     disentangle mainstream from secondary options.
     Finite difference requires new testing in case they are revived.

4) raregas:
     This option will be skipped in public version. All specific
     subroutines have been moved  to subdirectory 'QMMM' to
     disentangle them from the mainstream routines.
 
5) 'calc_projFine':
     This version presently only for electronic part, not yet
     in ionic force. Should we put it there also?

6) preprocessor options 'simpar' and 'paraworld':
     Have been removed. 

7) Subroutine 'mergetabs':
     What is this routine doing?

8) Pseudo-potentials:
    a) The 'pseudogead.F90', 'pseudosoft.F90', and 'nonloc.DF90' should
       be combined to a module 'pseudo' with 'pseudo.F90' as header.
       Implementation of 'nonloc.F90' may raise difficulties due to
       REAL and COMPLEX versions.
    b) Interpolation to finer mesh should be checked carefully.

9) File 'localize.F90':
    a) Array 'rho' not used. Check and remove.
    b) Check dynamical case.

10) Routine 'leapfr' in 'ionmd.F90':
     List variable 'ityp' obsolete without QMMM. Skip or what?
