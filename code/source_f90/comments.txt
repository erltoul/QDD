Open points concering QDD code:
-------------------------------

Preprocessor:
Make all array allocatable. Then we can skip all preprocessor
flags except those for parallelization.

SIC:
skip GAM and localized SIC?

attachement:
skip from public version.

iscatterelectron:
skip form public version?

afterburn by imaginary-time propagation:
This sequency has been moved to a separate routine in 'afterburn.F90'.
It works only for exponential evolution. Does it make sense?

IFSICP==8:
this option perhaps not yet properly implemented on new repository.
Check performance.

Mask:
possibly not yet fully imported. Check.

Calc_var:
Projection in calculation of variance?

raregas:
try to collect at few points and skip in public section.




private versus public sector:
If all preprocessor parameters, except for parallelization,
are replaced by dynamical variables (see above), we can
skip parts of the package from the public sector by
placing dummies instead of the real files for the relevant
subroutines. We may consider hiding the content of the hidden
options by giving the hidden routines innocent names as
'CALL user_interface_1(...)'  etc.
