Open points concering QDD code:
-------------------------------

Preprocessor:
Make all array allocatable. Then we can skip all preprocessor
flags.

SIC:
skip GAM and localized SIC?

attachement:
skip from public version.

iscatterelectron:
skip form public version?

afterburn by imaginary-time propagation:
This sequency has been moved to a separate routine in 'afterburn.F90'.
It works only for exponential evolution. Does it make sense?

IFSICP==8:
this option perhaps not yet properly implemented on new repository.
Check performance.

Mask:
possibly not yet fully imported. Check.

Calc_var:
Projection in calculation of variance?

raregas:
try to collect at few points and put to private section.
