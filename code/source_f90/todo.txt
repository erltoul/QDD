1) redundant compile-time options: 
      gridfft <-->  netlib_fft & fftw_cpu   ; try to deduce gridfft from both others

2) makefile:
      write documentation for handling 'makefile'

3) option 'coudoub3D':
      check performance on various platforms and decide for one option

4) entry of options:
      trhough 'define.h' as well as through 'makefile'
      try to have only one channel
      possibly write a batch file with interactive entry of options
      (see 'make.sh')

5) finite differences:
      this seems to be installed, but requires more testing;
      before spending time on that, run benchmarks.

6) raregas:
      this option has not been used for long, need testing.
